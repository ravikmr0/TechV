            </p>

            <h2>Shipping Methods & Delivery Times</h2>
            <p>
              We work with trusted couriers to deliver orders domestically and internationally. Delivery times depend on the shipping method selected at checkout, the destination, and customs clearance where applicable.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Standard Domestic: 3–7 business days</li>
              <li>Expedited Domestic: 1–3 business days</li>
              <li>International: 7–21 business days (varies by country and customs)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Shipping Costs</h2>
            <p>
              Shipping charges are calculated at checkout based on the order weight, dimensions, destination, and chosen service. Where promotional free-shipping offers apply, the terms will be shown during checkout.
            </p>

            <h2>Order Processing</h2>
            <p>
              Orders are typically processed within 1–2 business days after payment confirmation. Processing time may increase for custom-built items or large-volume orders.
            </p>

            <h2>Tracking</h2>
            <p>
              Once your order ships, you will receive a confirmation email with tracking details. Use the tracking number to monitor your shipment on the carrier's website.
            </p>

            <h2>Customs, Duties & Taxes</h2>
            <p>
              For international shipments, customs duties and import taxes may apply and are the responsibility of the recipient unless otherwise stated. Delivery times may be affected by customs processing.
            </p>

            <h2>Returns & Exchanges</h2>
            <p>
              If you receive a damaged, defective, or incorrect item, please contact us within 14 days of delivery to arrange a return, replacement, or refund. Items must be returned in their original condition unless otherwise agreed.
            </p>

                Return Shipping: We may provide a prepaid return label for qualifying returns; otherwise, return shipping costs are the responsibility of the customer unless the return is due to our error.
              </li>
              <li>
                Refund Processing: Refunds are issued to the original payment method within 5–10 business days of receiving the returned items and completing inspection.

              </li>
              <li>
                Lost-in-transit claims will be handled per the carrier's policy; we will assist filing claims for insured shipments.
